# hdv2003-dashboard

It's a simple shiny dashboard based on *hdv2003* (Histoire de Vie) dataset provided by the *questionr* package.

hdv2003 is a sample from 2000 people and 20 variables taken from the Histoire de Vie survey,
produced in France in 2003 by INSEE. In this example, we just used the first 300 rows. 

This dashboard is not for analytical purpose, but just to show what can be done with shiny and shinydashboard packages.

The live dashboard is available [here](https://bervelin.shinyapps.io/dataviz-hdv2003/)
